  ANSWER:
  1. I created TEST to test writing and updating files on github.
  2. I created CHALLENGE to begin solving the original problem and then the bonus. My logic is included as the comments inside the code. 
  3. I uploaded images of the final code as applied to the full data set. 

*Code for this project was written before we linked Github to our local, so code was written directly into github (as opposed to being uploaded).
